========

Simple and verbose background rendering launcher/script-generator for Blender

--------

description:

The script allow you to easily set up a background render command for Blender.
It will also ask you if you want to generate micro-script with current setting (this come handy if you want to render the file again with exacts same parameters later)

The script can create/update a log file with render-time information.
It can also power off your computer after renderâ€™s end.

Usage:
Place the script in your *.blend* file directory and execute it.

Optionnal: If you prefer command line, you can add it to your path (allow you to launch from CLI from the *.blend* file directory without moving the script file)
